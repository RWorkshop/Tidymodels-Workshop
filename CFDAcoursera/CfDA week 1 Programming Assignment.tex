\section{Reading in a CSV file}
% Section 1
To read in a csv file, it is convenient to save it to your \textit{\textbf{working directory}}, the default file directory that \texttt{R} uses. Once it is in the working directory, you can use the \texttt{read.csv()} command to load it into the \texttt{R} environment.
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
getwd()
#[1] "C:/Users/Computer5/Documents"

HW0 <- read.csv("hw0_data.csv",header = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
You can change the working directory using the \texttt{setwd()} to the one you require.
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
getwd()
#[1] "C:/Users/Computer5/Documents"

setwd("C:/Users/Computer5/Documents/R")

#  > getwd()
#  [1] "C:/Users/Computer5/Documents/R"
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
